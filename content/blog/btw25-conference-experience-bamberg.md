I had such a pleasant time at the [BTW conference](https://btw2025.uni-bamberg.de/) at [Fakult√§t Wirtschaftsinformatik und Angewandte Informatik (WIAI)](https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/wiai/) in [Bamberg](https://www.bamberg.info/en/) this week. The organizers were wonderful, and kept me well caffeinated (thank you coffee bike). The lectures and workshops were such a treat for someone who is at the beginning of their research journey. Meeting so many people whose names I only saw on research papers was, as always, quite an experience. Many thanks to the organizers and the speakers. Special thanks to the [TUMuchData team](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dasl/tumuchdata/) for the conference scholarship. Looking forward to the next one in [Munich](https://www.muenchen.de/en).

The conference featured an excellent coffee service, which was much appreciated during the long days of presentations and networking.

The poster sessions were particularly valuable, allowing researchers to present their work in an interactive format and engage in detailed discussions with attendees.

The BTW conference is the most important database conference in the German-speaking area, organized by the [Database and Information Systems Special Interest Group](https://fg-dbs.gi.de/) of the [German Informatics Society (GI)](https://gi.de/).

One of the highlights of attending the conference was experiencing the beautiful city of Bamberg, a [UNESCO World Heritage Site](https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/624/). The iconic [Old Town Hall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Rathaus) built on a bridge over the Regnitz River is one of the city's most famous landmarks.
