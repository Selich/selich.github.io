Excited to announce that I've started working with the **TRL Lab** at University of Amsterdam on LLM research! 

I'm working as a research student with [Prof. Madelon Hulsebos](https://www.madelonhulsebos.com) and [Daniel Gomm](https://www.daniel-gomm.com) on generative AI and information retrieval for structured data, exploring areas like NL2SQL and foundation model applications. Looking forward to visiting Amsterdam during this collaboration and contributing to the lab's research on advancing how we work with data and AI systems.

You can find more about the lab and team at [TRL Lab People](https://trl-lab.github.io/people/).
