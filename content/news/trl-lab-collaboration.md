Excited to announce that I've started working with the **TRL Lab** at University of Amsterdam on LLM research! Working as a research student with [Prof. Madelon Hulsebos](https://www.madelonhulsebos.com) and [Daniel Gomm](https://www.daniel-gomm.com) on generative AI and information retrieval for structured data. Looking forward to visiting Amsterdam during this collaboration!
