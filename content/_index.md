Hi, welcome to my website! I'm a student at [TUM](https://www.tum.de/) where I work as a Teaching Assistant for Introduction to Informatics. I'm currently a Security Researcher Intern at [Firebolt](https://www.firebolt.io/) and also collaborating with the [TRL Lab](https://trl-lab.github.io/) at [CWI](https://www.cwi.nl/).

My research interests are focused on ML4Systems, LLMs, security and privacy. I'm particularly interested in how machine learning can be applied to improve system performance, reliability, and security, as well as the intersection of large language models with systems research.

I try to keep the site style quite minimal because I want to focus on the content. If you like it you can find the source code [in my repo](https://github.com/Selich/selich.github.io). Feel free to use it as you prefer.

If you want to hire me here you have my [CV](/cv).
