Hi, welcome to my website! I use this tiny part of the internet to share my thoughts about ML4Systems, LLMs, security and privacy. I also plan on writing about history, philosophy, and linguistics.

I try to keep the site style quite minimal because I want to focus on the content. If you like it you can find the source code [in my repo](https://github.com/Selich/selich.github.io). Feel free to use it as you prefer.

If you want to hire me here you have my [CV](/cv).
