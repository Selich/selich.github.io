  <p>I had such a pleasant time at the <a href="https://btw2025.uni-bamberg.de/">BTW conference</a> at <a href="https://www.uni-bamberg.de/en/wiai/">Fakultät Wirtschaftsinformatik und Angewandte Informatik (WIAI)</a> in <a href="https://www.bamberg.info/en/">Bamberg</a> this week. The organizers were wonderful, and kept me well caffeinated (thank you coffee bike). The lectures and workshops were such a treat for someone who is at the beginning of their research journey. Meeting so many people whose names I only saw on research papers was, as always, quite an experience. Many thanks to the organizers and the speakers. Special thanks to the <a href="https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/en/dasl/tumuchdata/">TUMuchData team</a> for the conference scholarship. Looking forward to the next one in <a href="https://www.muenchen.de/en">Munich</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/btw25/coffee-bike.jpg" alt="Coffee bike at the conference venue"></p>
<p>The conference featured an excellent coffee service, which was much appreciated during the long days of presentations and networking.</p>
<p><img src="/images/btw25/poster-session.jpg" alt="Conference hall with poster presentations"></p>
<p>The poster sessions were particularly valuable, allowing researchers to present their work in an interactive format and engage in detailed discussions with attendees.</p>
<p><img src="/images/btw25/conference-badge.jpg" alt="BTW25 Conference Badge"></p>
<p>The BTW conference is the most important database conference in the German-speaking area, organized by the <a href="https://fg-dbs.gi.de/">Database and Information Systems Special Interest Group</a> of the <a href="https://gi.de/">German Informatics Society (GI)</a>.</p>
<p><img src="/images/btw25/bamberg-old-town-hall.jpg" alt="Bamberg&rsquo;s Old Town Hall (Altes Rathaus)"></p>
<p>One of the highlights of attending the conference was experiencing the beautiful city of Bamberg, a <a href="https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/624/">UNESCO World Heritage Site</a>. The iconic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamberg_Rathaus">Old Town Hall</a> built on a bridge over the Regnitz River is one of the city&rsquo;s most famous landmarks.</p>
